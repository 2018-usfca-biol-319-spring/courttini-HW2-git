# Difference seen between the two scatterplots

As seen from the two pdf's, the scatterplot of the dry mass of flowers from Treehaven is significantly different from Harvard Forest. There is first a difference in the dry mass of flowers in grams. In Treehaven the highest amount of dry mass recorded was around 12.  While in Harvard Forest the highest amount of dry mass recorded was almost 6. These could both be outliers, however. The ecological explanation for this could be that the trees/plants grown in each of these areas produce different types of flowers and therefore produce different sizes of flowers contributing to the varying amounts of dry mass.  

Explain what you think could be the ecological reason for the differences or lack of differences that you observed, based on your reading of the overview information about each of the sites on the NEON website.
