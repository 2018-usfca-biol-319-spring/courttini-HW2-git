# Difference seen between the two scatterplots

As seen from the two pdf's, the scatterplot of the dry mass of flowers from Treehaven is significantly different from Harvard Forest. There is a difference in the dry mass of flowers in grams between the two sites. In Treehaven the highest amount of dry mass recorded was around 12. While in Harvard Forest the highest amount of dry mass recorded was almost 6. These could be outliers. The ecological explanation for this could be that the trees/plants grown in each of these areas produce different types of flowers and therefore produce different sizes of flowers contributing to the varying amounts of dry mass. Treehaven is in Wisconsin, while Harvard forest is in Massachusetts.

There are varying amounts of dry mass of flowers in grams during each month at both sites. This could be because of the weather differences at each location. At Treehaven, there seems to be an average annual temperature of 41.6 degrees fahrenheit and at Harvard Forest the average temperature in the summer is 68 degrees fahrenheit, while in the winter it is 19 degrees fahrenheit. As seen from the plot, dry mass in Treehaven looks to be more abundant in June, and then in late September to early November. Dry mass of the flowers for the Harvard Forest is seen almost year around except in January and is more abundant in the summer months of May through August. The anount of sunlight and how long in the day the sun lasts, contributes to the 

Another thing that can contribute to this difference in these plots are the habitats these flowers are from. Treehaven's habitat site is at the Great Lakes and it spans 1400 acres.
