# Difference seen between the two scatter plots

As seen from the two PDFs, the scatter plot of the dry mass of flowers from Treehaven is significantly different from Harvard Forest. There is a difference in the dry mass of flowers in grams between the two sites. In Treehaven the highest amount of dry mass recorded was around 12. While in Harvard Forest the highest amount of dry mass recorded was almost 6. These could be outliers. The ecological explanation for this could be that the trees/plants grown in each of these areas produce different types of flowers and therefore produce different sizes of flowers contributing to the varying amounts of dry mass. Treehaven is in Wisconsin, while Harvard forest is in Massachusetts.

There are varying amounts of dry mass of flowers in grams during each month at both sites. This could be because of the weather differences at each location. At Treehaven, there seems to be an average annual temperature of 41.6 degrees Fahrenheit and at Harvard Forest the average temperature in the summer is 68 degrees Fahrenheit, while in the winter it is 19 degrees Fahrenheit. As seen from the plot, dry mass in Treehaven looks to be more abundant in June, and then in late September to early November. Dry mass of the flowers for the Harvard Forest is seen almost year around except in January and is more abundant in the summer months of May through August. The amount of sunlight and how long in the day the sun lasts, contributes to the cycle of photosynthesis of the plant and the flowers on it. 

Another thing that can contribute to this difference in these plots are the habitats these flowers are from. Treehaven's habitat site is at the Great Lakes and it spans 1,400 acres. Its background includes it being heavily harvested and burned with wildfires from the 1800's to 1930. Then, until the 1950's it was farming land. 
At Harvard Forest there are a variety of habitats including northern, transition, and central forests; marshes, swamps, and conifer-dominated bogs; and forest plantations. Harvard Forest spans about 3,750 acres with many research areas. Its history starts as a research site in the early 1900's and that is still the main focus today. The history can explain the more dry mass abundance that is seen in Harvard Forest. Treehaven's site is smaller, and newer from the fires that the ecosystem is still growing.
